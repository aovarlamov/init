To authenticate using SSH keys, a user must have an SSH key pair on their local 
computer. On the remote server, the public key must be copied to a file within 
the userâ€™s home directory at ~/.ssh/authorized_keys. This file contains a list 
of public keys, one-per-line, that are authorized to log into this account.
